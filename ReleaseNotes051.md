Bug Fixes:

  * Zone name has been added to web.xml and is used to generate home dir for users.
  * Only accessible resources are retrieved when changing the default resource.

Upgrade from 0.5.0:

  * replace $JETTY\_HOME/webapps/root/WEB-INF/lib/davis.jar
  * replace $JETTY\_HOME/webapps/root/WEB-INF/web.xml and modify it accordingly
