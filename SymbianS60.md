To set up,

  1. Press "Options", select "New drive"
  1. Give it a name in "Name"
  1. Enter Davis URL in "Address", e.g. https://davis.server.name/Zone/home/username
  1. In "Access Point", select "Always Ask", it will pop up a list of Access Points.
  1. Enter your username and password in "User name" and "Password", this is the same as you enter for web browser/PC WebDAV client.

  1. Go to Menu -> Tools -> File mgr., you'll see a new remote drive you just created.
  1. Navigate to it and press middle button, or press "Options" and select "connect"
  1. You'll usually get a list of Access Points. select the one you want to use
  1. You then enter your WebDAV collection! You can browse your file on Davis, and open them. Basically, you can open images files, PDF files, TXT files, video (RM/MP4/...) files and Office (word/powerpoint) files.
  1. You can copy files from your mobile/memory card to Davis, or vise versa. To copy a file to Davis, from File mgr., select your phone memory or memory card, navigate to a file you want to copy, press "Options", select "Organise" -> "Copy to folder", then you can select your Davis drive and then select a destination collection.

Limitations:
  1. As mobiles have very limited memory, they are not likely to handle huge data. If you have too many files in one collection, you are likely to get a "no data" message. From a test on Nokia N78, which is a cheap mobile with 64MB memory, it can only open a collection with 30-40 items, including sub-collections and files.
  1. You may not be able to open a large file. From the test on Nokia N78, it cannot open a file larger than 3MB.
