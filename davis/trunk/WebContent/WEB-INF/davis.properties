#########################################################################

# Request URI charset. Default is "UTF-8".
#        Specifies the character set used to interpret request URIs.
#
#        When a request contains characters outside the 7-bit ASCII set, 
#        Davis must interpret them according to a selected character set. 
#        Most clients will use UTF-8 to request such resources; some versions 
#        of Windows' Web Folders client notably vary from this. If the request 
#        does not match a resource with this character set, Davis will 
#        re-attempt using UTF-8.
#request-uri.charset=

# acceptBasic:
#
#        Indicates whether HTTP Basic authentication is accepted by Davis 
#        if sent proactively by the client.
#
#        Specifies whether HTTP Basic credentials are accepted by Davis 
#        when presented by clients. This differs from "jcifs.http.enableBasic" 
#        in that HTTP Basic authentication will not be offered as a choice by 
#        the server; it will just accept such credentials if sent proactively 
#        by clients. If enabled, HTTP Basic will only be accepted over secure 
#        connections (HTTPS) by default.
#
#        This setting is ignored if "jcifs.http.enableBasic" is set to "true".
#
#        Default Value:
#            false (HTTP Basic is not accepted unless offered).
#acceptBasic=false

# alwaysAuthenticate:
#
#        Determines whether authentication of the end user is always performed, 
#        or only performed if required by the resource being accessed.
#
#        If set to "true", authentication will always be requested (even if not 
#        normally required to access the resource in question). This prevents 
#        anonymous browsing of unprotected resources. Note that if a default 
#        domain controller is not set (either via "jcifs.smb.client.domain" or 
#        "jcifs.http.domainController") the root will still be anonymously 
#        browseable.
#
#        Default Value:
#            true (authentication is always performed if possible).
#alwaysAuthenticate=true

# closeOnAuthenticate:
#
#        Specifies whether Davis should close the HTTP connection when 
#        starting authentication.
#
#        This setting specifies if Davis should send the "Connection: 
#        close" HTTP header when initially responding to requests for 
#        authentication. This is not necessary, but more closely mirrors the 
#        behavior of IIS. Note that setting this to "true" will have an 
#        adverse impact on performance.
#
#        Default Value:
#            false (the HTTP connection remains open throughout the authentication sequence).
#closeOnAuthenticate=false

# contextBase:
#
#        Specifies a base HTTP context to apply to URIs within Davis.
#
#        This setting specifies a base context for URL rewriting, used to 
#        deploy Davis in a reverse proxying scenario. Davis will 
#        rewrite URLs relative to the supplied URL context.
#
#		 Default is none.
#contextBase=

# contextBaseHeader:
#
#        Indicates the name of an HTTP header containing a context base to 
#        apply to URIs within Davis.
#
#        This specifies an HTTP header that will provide Davis with a 
#        context base for URL rewriting. If the request carries this header, 
#        the value will be used as the rewriting context, overriding any value 
#        specified in the "contextBase" parameter. If the header is not 
#        present, th value in the "contextBase" parameter will be used (if 
#        available).
#
#		 Default is none.
#contextBaseHeader=

# webdavis.Log
#
#        Specifies the logging implementation classname.
#
#        This setting provides the classname of the logging implementation. 
#        The specified class must extend "webdavis.Log" and provide a no-argument 
#        constructor.
#
#        If not specified, a default logger will be used which logs to 
#        System.out and System.err.
#webdavis.Log=

# webdavis.Log.threshold:
#
#        Specifies the logging threshold.
#
#        This configures the threshold level for logging events. Levels are 
#        cumulative; for example, specifying "WARNING" will log warnings, 
#        errors, and critical errors.
#
#        Valid settings include:
#
#            NOTHING
#                Nothing is logged.
#
#            CRITICAL
#                Critical errors are logged.
#
#            ERROR
#               Errors are logged.
#
#            WARNING
#                Warnings are logged.
#
#            INFORMATION
#                Informational messages are logged.
#
#            DEBUG
#                Debug messages are logged.
#
#        Default Value:
#            CRITICAL (only critical errors are logged).
#webdavis.Log.threshold=CRITICAL

# jargon.debug:
#
#       Specifies the logging threshold for the jargon library.
#
#		Logging levels available:
#
#			ERROR 	- this setting will generate the least amount of log information, 
#                   	and will only display errors.
#			WARN 	- this is the default setting, and will display errors that result
#                   	in exceptions, as well as other conditions that are exceptional, 
#						but are logged and bypassed.
#			INFO 	- this setting will provide details of the progress of a Jargon 
#						function, and is useful to get a good picture of where execution
#						is occurring.
#			DEBUG 	- this is the finest setting, and will give details about Jargon
#						activities, including dumps of data and XML protocol 
#						communications between Jargon and IRODS.
#
#       Default Value:
#       	WARN 
#jargon.debug=WARN

# maximumXmlRequest:
#
#        Specifies the maximum allowable size for an XML request sent by the 
#        client.
#
#        This specifies the maximum size of an XML request document in bytes. 
#        When processing XML-based requests (such as LOCK or PROPFIND), 
#        Davis uses this parameter to control the amount of data that will 
#        be accepted from the client. This protects against certain XML-based 
#        denial of service attacks, in which the client sends a very large 
#        request in an attempt to consume all available server resources.
#
#        Default Value:   
#            20000 (about 20 kilobytes).
#maximumXmlRequest=20000

# insecureConnection:
#
#        Indicates which authentication method will be used if users establish
#        an insecure connection (HTTP). The supported values are:
#
#        	shib (shibboleth authentication)
#        	basic (basic authentication, really not secure, use it if you know what you are doing!)
#        	block (doesn't allow insecure connections)
#			digest (will be supported in the future)
#
#        	Default Value:  
#            	block
#insecureConnection=block

# disableSLCSAuthentication:
#
# 		Disable SLCS authentication. SLCS authentication can be enabled by 
#		setting this to false.
