#summary Commandline client

=== cadaver ===

[http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/ cadaver] is a command-line client for UNIX users to connect a WebDAV server. 

The installation is very simple. For example, under MacOS, you can use port.
{{{
port install cadaver
}}}

For Linux, you can use yum to install it.

To use it, you can just need to enter the WebDAV URL following the command, e.g.
{{{
cadaver https://df.arcs.org.au/ARCS/home
}}}
Then you'll get a prompt for username/password. After you get in, you can type ''help'' to list supported commands. Basically, you can use normal unix commands, such as cd, rm, mkdir. The use is somewhat like a FTP client.
