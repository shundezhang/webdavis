#summary Mac client setup guide

Mac users use '''Finder''' as webdav client.

Before using Davis, it is strongly suggested that .DS_Store file creation should be disabled over network connections. To do that,
(From http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1629)

 1. Open the Terminal.
 2. Type:
{{{
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
}}}
 3. Press Return.
 4. Restart the computer.
Note: This will affect the user's interactions with SMB/CIFS, AFP, NFS, and WebDAV servers.

To setup a Davis connection:
 1. In the Finder, press Cmd-k . (Alternatively, from the Go menu, choose Connect to Server.)

Alternatively, other client can be used to prevent from the generation of .DS_Store files. [http://cyberduck.ch/ CyberDuck] is an option.

To use CyberDuck, put details like this.
