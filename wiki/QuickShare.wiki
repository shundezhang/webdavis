#summary how to config QuickShare


== QuickShare ==

The QuickShare feature allows each users to easily share files they own (have uploaded them) by generating a link that can be externally accessed by anyone who has the link (with a unique hash). The link can be accessed without having an account on the server - which makes it much easier to share files with either individual collaborators who do not have server accounts - or making a file public.

The QuickShare feature is implemented by a separate servlet running on the same server as Davis. The servlet is connecting to iRODS separately, under its own account (typically called QuickShare).

To get QuickShare going (in Davis 0.9.3+):

    * Create the iRODS QuickShare user - as an ordinary rodsuser user, picking a random password 


{{{
iadmin mkuser QuickShare rodsuser
iadmin moduser QuickShare password QUICKSHARE-PASSWORD

}}}

    * Add the following attributes to the Davis configuration (davis-host.properties) 


{{{
# QuickShare: metadata attribute name
sharing-key=QuickShare

# QuickShare: iRODS account & and server connection details
sharing-user=QuickShare
sharing-password=QUICKSHARE-PASSWORD
sharing-host=irods.institution.org.au
sharing-port=1247
sharing-zone=ARCS

# QuickShare - URL prefix for the Davis server
sharing-URL-prefix=https://df.arcs.org.au/quickshare

}}}

    * Patch your iRODS server so that it can can properly expand the userNameClient variable in acAclPolicy rule (used below). Apply the [http://projects.arcs.org.au/svn/systems/trunk/dataFabricScripts/iRODS/BugFix/patches-2.4/aclpolicy_username.patch aclpolicy_username.patch patch] to server/api/src/rsGenQuery.c and recompile and restart your iRODS server. 

    * Add a rule exempting the QuickShare user from the acAclPolicy STRICT policy to your rules files in iRODS/server/config/reConfigs (replacing the existing acAclPolicy rule)


{{{
      acAclPolicy|"$userNameClient" != "QuickShare"|msiAclPolicy(STRICT)|nop

}}}

    * Add a !ProxyPass directive for /quickshare into /etc/httpd/conf.d/df.conf:


{{{
      ProxyPass /quickshare ajp://localhost:8009/quickshare flushpackets=on

}}}

    * Restart Davis and reload Apache 


{{{
service davis restart
service httpd reload

}}}
