#summary ReleaseNotes 0.9.2

Updates:

  * Rejects '/' in file names in dialogs.

  * Recursive delete in trash uses Jargon call for speed. Previously this was buggy in Jargon and so Davis did the recursion (slower) instead.

  * Jargon library comes from the trunk rather than the temporary hacked version.

New features:

  * Davis detects loss of server connection and automatically resets it (from the UI).

  * Replica button added. This allows users to view and change replicas for a file.

  * UI checks that dojo's version is what's expected.

  * Upload and Create Directory buttons are disabled in readonly directories.

Bug Fixes:

  * Handles newlines in file names.

  * Jargon exceptions are now caught when closing sessions.

  * Empty file names are rejected for rename and create directory.

  * Unicode file names are now handled correctly.

  * Navigation is disabled during change directory to avoid UI confusion.

  * The Access Control dialog user list is no longer limited to 300 items.

  * Added no-cache directives to response header when downloading files. Should prevent browser caching of downloads.

  * When listing or getting a file, Davis now returns a clean replica if available, otherwise if only a dirty replica exists, it returns that. Solves problems with Finder and iRODS 2.3 where zero length files are now shown as dirty.
