= Welcome to Davis (A Web__DAV__-__i__RODS/__S__RB gateway) =

Davis is a Java web application aiming to provide a webdav interface for accessing the SDSC iRods/SRB data grid. Its [wiki:idea idea] is "Enabling iRODS/SRB to the rest of the world", with the use of general Webdav protocol and HTTP protocol.

iRODS/SRB is widely used by many research groups in the world. Quite a few different clients have been developed, e.g. iCommands/Scommands, Hermes, JUX. However, they all required a third-party software, and a non-HTTP port, 1247/5544. The issues are: some software may require a certain IT knowledge to install; some sites may have firewall blocking non-HTTP(S) access.

[wiki:Webdav Webdav] is a protocol designed for web page development. It offers basic file management methods, such as directory browsing, basic file information retrieving, creating/deleting directories, file upload/download. Also it runs on port 80(HTTP) or 443(HTTPS), which is not likely be blocked by firewalls (For some organizations, a http proxy will be used).

== Features ==

 * Webdav version 1, 2. Supports locking mechanism.
 * Supports Windows, Linux and Mac 
 * iRODS and Shibboleth authentication with WAYF
 * Supports user password and Shibboleth authentication on SRB 
 * Uses tilde(~) for home directory 
 * Supports browser mode, where users can download and browse files 
 * Change permissions, add/modify/delete metadata in Browse mode 
 * Support multi-threaded and resumable download, e.g. using [http://www.flashget.com/download.htm FlashGet]
