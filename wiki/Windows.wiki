(In this guide, we assume that Davis is installed on a machine named adelaide.sasr.edu.au.)

== Windows XP ==

In Windows XP, you can use the '''Add Network Place Wizard''' or '''Internet Explorer''' to upload and access your files via WebDAV, if you have the required permissions.
=== Using the "Add Network Place" Wizard ===

To use the '''Add Network Place''' Wizard to add a shortcut to your computer that allows you to upload and access files in SRB/iRODS using WebDAV:

   1. On the desktop, double-click My Network Places.

   2. In the "Network Tasks" pane, click Add a network place.

   3. On the welcome screen, click Next.

   4. Select Choose another network location, and then click Next.

   5. In the "Internet or network address:" field, enter a URL that points to the destination Resources tool. For example,
{{{
    https://adelaide.sasr.edu.au/<SRB collection> 
}}}
    See [wiki:HowTo/General General doc] for details.

   6. When prompted, enter your username and password. See [wiki:HowTo/General General doc] for details.

You may now drag and drop files and folders between your computer and the sites to which you just connected. However, you cannot delete items from a site by dragging them to the Recycle Bin on your desktop. To delete an item, right-click it and select Delete.

   3. When prompted, enter your username and password like what is done for '''Network Place'''. See [wiki:HowTo/General General doc] for details.

The contents of the destination folder will appear in a window where you can open individual files, browse to other folders on your computer, and transfer files between folders.

When you're finished, exit Internet Explorer to close your connection.

== Windows Vista or Windows 7 ==

Connection to Davis can be accomplished using the NetDrive software which can be downloaded from http://www.netdrive.net and is free for non-commercial home use.

If you are using Windows Vista, you will also need to install a patch, as outlined at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907306

You can then connect to Davis as follows:

    * Double click on the NetDrive shortcut, then click "New Site". 
    * Enter "Davis" in the "Site name" field and select "WebDav"in the "Server Type" field.
    * Click the "Advanced" button and ensure that "UTF-8" appears in the "Encoding" field.
    * Also tick the "Use HTTPS" box, then click the "OK" button.
    * Select an appropriate (e.g. "W:") value in the "Drive" field, then fill out the "Account" and "Password" fields.
    * Click the "Connect" button and your home folder should appear.
    * You can now drag and drop files between that folder and any local folder as required!

== Windows Vista (This may not work!) ==

Windows Vista is shipped with a bug so your computer must have Microsoft's Software Update for Web Folders (KB907306) installed in order for WebDAV to function properly with Vista. The patch can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=17C36612-632E-4C04-9382-987622ED1D64. After installing this patch, you can go ahead to set up webdav.

 1. Select Computer from the Start icon
 2. With Computer selected in the left panel, you see "Map network drive" in the tool bar. Click on "Map network drive".
 3. On the "Map Network Drive" dialog, click on the "Connect to a Web site that you can use to store your documents and pictures" link.
 4. On the first of a series of "Add Network Location" dialogs, click Next.
 5. Select "Choose a custom network location." and click Next.
 6. Enter the URL of the network address and click Next.
 7. The network address the form:
{{{
    https://adelaide.sasr.edu.au/<SRB collection> 
}}}
    See [wiki:HowTo/General General doc] for details.
    Enter the User name and Password you use to log on to Learn@UW and access your course and click OK.
    To save your password, check "Remember my password."
    * Note: You may be prompted to enter your User name and password two or three times.
 8. Type a name for the network location.
    This is the name of the folder you will use to access your SRB files.
 9. Press Finish.
    In the left panel under "Folders", the name of the network location you chose in step 8 will appear in the list.
